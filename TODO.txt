TODO
====

* Add support in latex/tokenizer for environments which just have
  macros expanded and then collect all the tokens until the end of the
  environment.  Use this to simplify math-mode support
  (pass1.go/pass2.go in package latex), and to implement the
  tikzpicture environment.
* support \parskip and \parindent
* add a way to set the document ID (tex comment? default to title?
  directory name?)
* in pass 1, add line/column information to tokens for better error messages
* in xhtml mode, add an "index.xhtml" file as the entry point

* handle text before the first chapter/section
* should encoding/xml be used to generate META-INF/container.xml and
  OEBPS/content.opf?
* use some prefix (epub? latex?) for all auto-generated CSS?
* add beamer class support?
